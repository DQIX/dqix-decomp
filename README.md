# Dragon Quest IX: Sentinels of the Starry Skies Decompilation Project

## üìñ About
This project aims to create a **1:1 disassembly and decompilation** of *Dragon Quest IX: Sentinels of the Starry Skies* for the Nintendo DS.  
The primary focus is on the USA version of the game, with the goal of making it fully recompilable.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

### üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites
#### Programs
[Python 3.11 or newer](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

GCC 9+ (available through installers like MINGW on windows, usually included on linux)

[Ninja build system](https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/releases)

#### Setup
Place a clean ROM of the original game in the 'extract' folder and name it <baserom_dqix_(region).nds>, with (region) being the appropriate region identifier. ex: baserom_dqix_usa.nds

(Note: currently only the usa rom is supported)
Install the Python dependencies with pip
```shell
python -m pip install -r tools/requirements.txt
```
Run the script to configure Ninja (Do this any time a file is added or removed)
```shell
python tools/configure.py usa
```
Lastly, if you want the final ROM to be perfectly byte accurate you need to dump the ARM7 BIOS from your DS and place them in the root folder, under the name arm7_bios.bin

### üöÄ Building the Project
Once everything is set up:
1. Open the command line in the root folder of the repository.
2. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   ninja
   ```
This will initiate the compilation process.
