# Dragon Quest IX: Sentinels of the Starry Skies Decompilation Project

## üìñ About
This project aims to create a **1:1 disassembly and decompilation** of *Dragon Quest IX: Sentinels of the Starry Skies* for the Nintendo DS.  
The primary focus is on the USA and Japanese versions of the game, with the goal of making it fully recompilable.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

### üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites
#### Programs
[Python 3.11 or newer](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

GCC 9+ (available through installers like MINGW on windows, usually included on linux)

[Ninja build system](https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/releases)

#### Setup
Place a clean ROM of the original game in the 'extract' folder and name it <baserom_dqix_(region).nds>, with (region) being the appropriate region identifier. ex: baserom_dqix_usa.nds

(Note: currently only the usa and jpn roms are supported)

Install the Python dependencies with pip
```shell
python -m pip install -r tools/requirements.txt
```
Run the script to configure Ninja (Do this any time a file is added or removed)
```shell
python tools/configure.py <usa|jpn>
```

If using ghidra, be sure to create a successful build using ninja (see: [Building the Project](-building-the-project)) at least once before loading the game's config.yaml with ghidra. (For more information see See [Decompiling.md](Decompiling.md))

Lastly, if you want the final ROM to be perfectly byte accurate you need to dump the ARM7 BIOS from your DS and place them in the root folder, under the name arm7_bios.bin

### üöÄ Building the Project
Once everything is set up:
1. Open the command line in the root folder of the repository.
2. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   ninja
   ```
This will initiate the compilation process.

## ü§ù Contributing

### üì§ Submitting Contributions

> [!Important]
> Ensure the decompiled code you submit produces the **same binary** as the original release game. The build script should throw errors should your code not match.

### Decompiling code
See [Decompiling.md](Decompiling.md)

---

### üßë‚Äçüíª Current Goals
Disassemble and decompile accessible functions to begin mapping out the games code.

Get to the point where the strange function calls referenced on lines 26-28 of ARM9 main relocs.txt and lines 2695-2697 of overlay 1 relocs.txt can be understood

### üîß Useful Tools
1. **Ghidra** (with the NTRGhidra plugin):  
   - A powerful reverse engineering tool for DS games and code.  
   - [Download Ghidra](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/releases/tag/Ghidra_11.2.1_build) 
   - [Get dsd-ghidra Plugin (note: at current, ensure you use v0.2.1: 0.3.0 seems to be broken with the game)](https://github.com/AetiasHax/dsd-ghidra/releases/tag/v0.2.1)
   
2. **Desmume**:  
   - A DS emulator with excellent debugging features.  
   - [Download nightly builds](https://desmume.org/download/)

3. **No$GBA**:  
   - Another popular DS emulator for debugging, though less user-friendly.  
   - [Download No$GBA](https://problemkaputt.de/gba.htm)
